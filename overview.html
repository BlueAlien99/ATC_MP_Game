<p>This is the documentation for ATC_MP_GAME, a project realised for the PROZ (Event-driven programming) course at WUT FEIT.</p>

<p>ATC_MP_GAME is a simulator of air traffic control (ATC) written in Java 8 with use of JavaFX UI library and Java Sockets.</p>

<p>The simulator allows for both Single Player and Multi Player gameplay, with the client application serving as a server for other players to join. During the gameplay, the player is given a set of airplanes which they are supposed to control in such a way that they pass all checkpoints visible on the radar and do not collide with other aircraft. The player is given points for every checkpoint passed, based on the difficulty, and deducted points for irresponsible flying (i.e. collisions and unnecessary commands).</p>
